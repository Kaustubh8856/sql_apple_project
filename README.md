ðŸ›’ Retail Sales and Warranty Analysis â€“ SQL Project
This project is a comprehensive SQL-based analytical pipeline designed to derive key business insights from a retail dataset. It simulates real-world data involving product sales, store locations, warranty claims, and product categories.

ðŸ“‚ Database Schema
The project consists of the following tables:

stores â€“ Information about stores including location.
category â€“ Product categories.
products â€“ Product details including launch date and price.
sales â€“ Transactions and quantities sold.
warranty â€“ Warranty claims with repair status.

ðŸ”§ Features Implemented
Database Creation and Relationships: Designed normalized schema with proper foreign keys and constraints.
Performance Optimization: Created indexes on frequently queried fields like product_id, store_id, and sale_date to improve query execution time.

ðŸ“Š Key Analyses Performed
